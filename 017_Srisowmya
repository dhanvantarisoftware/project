Good evening to every one....
At first I'd like to introduce myself. I'm Kota Srisowmya n I'm coming from Visakhapatnam in the state of A.P.
According to my education, I studied till class 10th in Sri Chaitanya EM School in Narsipatnam 
and did my plus two from Sri Chaitanya Junior College in Visakhapatnam. 
Then I took the EMCET examination 
and got a good rank which earned me a free seat in Vignan's Institute of Engineering for Women, 
from where I did my Electrical Engineering. 
And I'm a fresher searching for job in IT field.
And my hobbies, I like singing and painting. 
and I'd like to cook new dishes.
I'm a very cool person and it's my strength.
Overthinking is my weakness but that can be converted into my strength.
Thank you sir for giving this opportunity.
